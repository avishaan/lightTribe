# Light Tribe Meeting
### Coffee Bar, San Francisco

1. Radius of post visibility, higher radius means you could charge for services to show up in larger radius. (future feature)
2. Alt monetization strategy by pay per click (future feature)
3. how do we consider smaller festivals such as mongolian festivals. It's a great way to allow people to find these festivals that they may not normally be able to find.
4. we may want to avoid big Coachella type festivals especially those festivals that don't care about anything.
5. focus on cultural festivals
6. we need automatic and scheduled posting (future feature)
7. eventually we want to be able to buy tickets from within the app (future feature)
8. we don't want to sell user data, but we can consider using that data in order to help connect users with services they may need in the future. (future feature)
9. potentially get someone in the Philippines to do some of the translation and filtering
