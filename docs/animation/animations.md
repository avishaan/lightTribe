- no closeup of the actual screen/app or illustration of the app
- message is for the second character to say "I already have answers"
- no music in the background
- no singing
- probably no text, no bubble
- product in english and spanish language
- voice should be funny but clear
- midwest without any type of american accent
- characters should be assexual a male should recognize itself
